## Small Language Models (SLMs)
- SLMs (and even "Tiny" ones) are largely sufficient for this type of functionality
  - You need to provide them with context at the right moment and not too much
- And they don't need many resources
- SLMs, if well selected and for simple use cases, handle function calling very well
