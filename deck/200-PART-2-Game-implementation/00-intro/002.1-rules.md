# 🏰 Rules 1/4

- The dungeon is extremely simple: a 4x4 square. (configurable in the `compose.yml` file)
- The **4 NPCs** and the **end-level Boss** are placed in advance in specific rooms.
- The name of the **Dungeon Master** is **Zephyr**
- We use the **"Dungeon Crawler"** principle (dungeon exploration) with dynamically generated rooms.
  - Once a room is generated (by an agent), it is stored in the `mcp-dungeon` MCP server (tool: `store_room`) and will no longer be modified (the player can return to the room).
> The 4 NPCs, the end-level Boss and the DM are AI Agents
