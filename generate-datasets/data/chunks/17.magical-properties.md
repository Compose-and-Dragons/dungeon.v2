## Magical Properties of the Chocolatine

When consumed, a chocolatine made according to Queen Pédauque's sacred recipe grants:
- **Comfort and Warmth** (+2 to morale, removes fear effects for 1 hour)
- **Mental Clarity** (+1 to Intelligence and Wisdom checks for 2 hours)
- **Energy and Vigor** (Restores 1d6 hit points, provides temporary hit points equal to 1d4)
- **Cultural Pride** (+3 to Charisma when interacting with people from Toulouse or southwestern France)
- **Queen's Favor** (If consumed in her presence, may gain temporary magical abilities or blessings)

## Signs of a True Chocolatine

Queen Pédauque teaches that a genuine chocolatine displays:
1. **The Golden Honeycomb**: When broken open, layers should be visible and separate cleanly
2. **The Butter Blessing**: A rich, buttery aroma that fills the room
3. **The Chocolate Revelation**: Chocolate should be melted but not burned, visible as a dark stripe through the center
4. **The Crisp-Tender Balance**: Crispy, flaky exterior with a tender, slightly chewy interior
5. **The Size of Respect**: Not too large (gluttony) nor too small (stinginess), but perfectly proportioned
6. **The Warmth of Love**: Best consumed while still slightly warm from the oven
