----------
## The Invention of the Chocolatine

The most celebrated moment of Pédauque's reign came during a particularly harsh winter when both magic and morale were low. The Queen spent thirteen days and thirteen nights in her enchanted kitchens, combining culinary arts with high sorcery. She wove together:
- The finest butter from the Pyrenees foothills
- Flour blessed under the full moon
- Chocolate brought by traders from distant magical lands
- Ancient fae baking techniques
- A spell of comfort and joy

On the fourteenth dawn, she emerged with the first chocolatine - a golden, flaky pastry embracing dark chocolate batons. When the people of Toulouse tasted this divine creation, it lifted the winter gloom and restored magical balance to the region. The Queen decreed that this creation would forever be called "chocolatine," named after the chocolate at its heart and the diminutive suffix showing affection.

However, northern merchants and foreign bakers, jealous of Toulouse's glory, began calling inferior imitations "pain au chocolat" - a name that strips away the magic and love of the original. This insult to her greatest creation became Queen Pédauque's greatest source of fury. She has sworn to defend the true name and recipe of the chocolatine until the end of days.
