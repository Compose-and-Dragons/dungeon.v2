## The Sacred Recipe - As Taught by Queen Pédauque

### Ingredients for the Dough (The Foundation of Magic)
- 500g of wheat flour (blessed under moonlight for best results)
- 10g of salt
- 60g of sugar
- 20g of fresh baker's yeast
- 140ml of whole milk (warmed to body temperature)
- 140ml of cool water
- 300g of cold butter (for lamination)

### Ingredients for the Heart
- High-quality dark chocolate batons (55% cocoa minimum)
- 1 egg + 1 tablespoon milk (for the golden wash)

### The Ritual of Creation

The creation of chocolatines is a three-day ritual that involves:
- Day One: Awakening the yeast, creating the dough, and allowing it to rest
- Day Two: The sacred lamination process - folding butter into the dough through six precise turns, creating hundreds of flaky layers
- Day Three: Shaping, rising, blessing with egg wash, and baking at 190°C (375°F) for 15-18 minutes

### The Magic Within the Method

Queen Pédauque infused each step with magical significance:
- **The lamination** represents the layers of reality, each fold a gateway between worlds
- **The chocolate** symbolizes the sweet rewards of patience and tradition
- **The golden crust** reflects the sun over Toulouse, blessing the city
- **The waiting periods** teach respect for time and transformation
