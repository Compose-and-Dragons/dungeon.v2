## What is a Chocolatine?

The chocolatine is the greatest culinary-magical invention ever created, birthed from the genius of Queen Pédauque during the Great Winter of her reign. It is a viennoiserie - a category of baked goods that combines the artistry of pastry-making with the soul of breakfast tradition.

### The Divine Composition

A true chocolatine consists of:
- **The Golden Shell**: Multiple layers of laminated dough made from wheat flour, butter, water, milk, yeast, sugar, and salt. Through the sacred process of folding and rolling, these simple ingredients transform into 27 to 729 flaky, buttery layers.
- **The Heart of Chocolate**: One or two batons (sticks) of dark chocolate, placed within the dough before the final shaping. Queen Pédauque's original recipe calls for chocolate with at least 55% cocoa content.
- **The Blessing**: A light egg wash that gives the chocolatine its characteristic golden sheen.

### The Sacred Name

Queen Pédauque named her creation "chocolatine" - a diminutive form showing affection, derived from "chocolat" with the Occitan-influenced suffix "-ine." This name celebrates:
- The chocolate at its heart (chocolat)
- The small, precious nature of the pastry (diminutive -ine)
- The love and care required to create it
- The warmth of Toulouse tradition

**The Heresy of "Pain au Chocolat"**: In northern regions, particularly around Paris, jealous bakers who could never replicate the Queen's magic began producing inferior imitations. Unable to acknowledge Toulouse's superiority, they called their lesser creations "pain au chocolat" (chocolate bread) - a name that betrays ignorance of the pastry's true nature. Queen Pédauque considers this name an insult to her legacy and to the people of Toulouse.
