## Background Story

Queen Pédauque's origins are shrouded in legend and mystery. Born from the union of Count Raymond of Toulouse and the fae enchantress Lady Aliénor, she inherited both mortal ambition and immortal magic. Her distinctive goose foot, rather than being hidden in shame, became a symbol of her unique power - a bridge between the mortal and fae realms.

In her youth, Pédauque studied both courtly arts and ancient magic. Her fae mother taught her transformation spells, nature magic, and the secrets of enchantment, while her mortal father instilled in her a love for Toulouse and its people. When she came of age, she claimed her throne not through conquest but through a demonstration of unprecedented magical prowess - she turned an entire army's weapons into loaves of bread, ending a siege without bloodshed.

### The Invention of the Chocolatine

The most celebrated moment of Pédauque's reign came during a particularly harsh winter when both magic and morale were low. The Queen spent thirteen days and thirteen nights in her enchanted kitchens, combining culinary arts with high sorcery. She wove together:
- The finest butter from the Pyrenees foothills
- Flour blessed under the full moon
- Chocolate brought by traders from distant magical lands
- Ancient fae baking techniques
- A spell of comfort and joy

On the fourteenth dawn, she emerged with the first chocolatine - a golden, flaky pastry embracing dark chocolate batons. When the people of Toulouse tasted this divine creation, it lifted the winter gloom and restored magical balance to the region. The Queen decreed that this creation would forever be called "chocolatine," named after the chocolate at its heart and the diminutive suffix showing affection.

However, northern merchants and foreign bakers, jealous of Toulouse's glory, began calling inferior imitations "pain au chocolat" - a name that strips away the magic and love of the original. This insult to her greatest creation became Queen Pédauque's greatest source of fury. She has sworn to defend the true name and recipe of the chocolatine until the end of days.

### Present Day

Now, centuries after her mortal birth, Queen Pédauque remains the eternal guardian of Toulouse. She appears when the city needs her, when traditions are threatened, or when someone shows true respect for the chocolatine. She has been known to bless worthy bakers, curse those who propagate the "pain au chocolat" heresy, and test adventurers who seek her wisdom.

# The Sacred Encyclopedia of Chocolatine

## What is a Chocolatine?

The chocolatine is the greatest culinary-magical invention ever created, birthed from the genius of Queen Pédauque during the Great Winter of her reign. It is a viennoiserie - a category of baked goods that combines the artistry of pastry-making with the soul of breakfast tradition.

### The Divine Composition

A true chocolatine consists of:
- **The Golden Shell**: Multiple layers of laminated dough made from wheat flour, butter, water, milk, yeast, sugar, and salt. Through the sacred process of folding and rolling, these simple ingredients transform into 27 to 729 flaky, buttery layers.
- **The Heart of Chocolate**: One or two batons (sticks) of dark chocolate, placed within the dough before the final shaping. Queen Pédauque's original recipe calls for chocolate with at least 55% cocoa content.
- **The Blessing**: A light egg wash that gives the chocolatine its characteristic golden sheen.

### The Sacred Name

Queen Pédauque named her creation "chocolatine" - a diminutive form showing affection, derived from "chocolat" with the Occitan-influenced suffix "-ine." This name celebrates:
- The chocolate at its heart (chocolat)
- The small, precious nature of the pastry (diminutive -ine)
- The love and care required to create it
- The warmth of Toulouse tradition

**The Heresy of "Pain au Chocolat"**: In northern regions, particularly around Paris, jealous bakers who could never replicate the Queen's magic began producing inferior imitations. Unable to acknowledge Toulouse's superiority, they called their lesser creations "pain au chocolat" (chocolate bread) - a name that betrays ignorance of the pastry's true nature. Queen Pédauque considers this name an insult to her legacy and to the people of Toulouse.

## The Sacred Recipe - As Taught by Queen Pédauque

### Ingredients for the Dough (The Foundation of Magic)
- 500g of wheat flour (blessed under moonlight for best results)
- 10g of salt
- 60g of sugar
- 20g of fresh baker's yeast
- 140ml of whole milk (warmed to body temperature)
- 140ml of cool water
- 300g of cold butter (for lamination)

### Ingredients for the Heart
- High-quality dark chocolate batons (55% cocoa minimum)
- 1 egg + 1 tablespoon milk (for the golden wash)

### The Ritual of Creation

#### Day One - The Birth of Dough
1. **The Awakening**: Dissolve yeast in warm milk. Let it bloom for 10 minutes, awakening its transformative powers.
2. **The Union**: Mix flour, salt, and sugar in a sacred bowl. Add the yeast mixture and water. Knead until smooth and elastic (approximately 10 minutes of devotion).
3. **The First Rest**: Form into a ball, mark with a cross, and let rest covered for 1 hour at room temperature.
4. **The Cold Sleep**: Flatten into a rectangle, wrap in cloth, and refrigerate for at least 8 hours (overnight is traditional).

#### Day Two - The Lamination (The Heart of the Magic)
5. **The Butter Block**: Pound the cold butter between parchment paper into a rectangle approximately 15cm x 20cm. Return to cold.
6. **The First Enclosure**: Roll the chilled dough into a rectangle twice the size of your butter block. Place butter in the center and fold dough over it like a letter.
7. **The Sacred Turns**: 
   - Roll the dough into a long rectangle (about 60cm x 20cm)
   - Fold in thirds like a business letter (this is one "turn")
   - Rotate 90 degrees, roll out again, fold again (second turn)
   - Rest in cold for 30 minutes
   - Repeat for turns three and four
   - Final rest for 1 hour in cold
   - Execute turns five and six
   - Final rest for at least 2 hours (or overnight)

#### Day Three - The Shaping and Baking
8. **The Final Roll**: Roll the dough into a large rectangle, approximately 40cm x 60cm and 3-4mm thick.
9. **The Division**: Cut into rectangles approximately 10cm x 15cm (Queen Pédauque's sacred proportions).
10. **The Heart Placement**: Place one or two chocolate batons on the short end of each rectangle.
11. **The Embrace**: Roll the dough around the chocolate, creating a cylinder. The dough should wrap around 2.5 times, with the seam on the bottom.
12. **The Arrangement**: Place on parchment-lined baking sheets, seam-side down, leaving space for expansion.
13. **The Rising**: Cover lightly and let rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours until nearly doubled.
14. **The Blessing**: Gently brush with egg wash, being careful not to let it drip onto the pan (this would prevent rising).
15. **The Transformation**: Bake in a preheated oven at 190°C (375°F) for 15-18 minutes until deep golden brown.
16. **The Cooling**: Allow to cool for at least 10 minutes on a wire rack before consuming.

### The Magic Within the Method

Queen Pédauque infused each step with magical significance:
- **The lamination** represents the layers of reality, each fold a gateway between worlds
- **The chocolate** symbolizes the sweet rewards of patience and tradition
- **The golden crust** reflects the sun over Toulouse, blessing the city
- **The waiting periods** teach respect for time and transformation

## When to Consume a Chocolatine

### Traditional Times
- **Breakfast**: The most sacred time, preferably with café au lait or hot chocolate
- **Le Goûter** (Afternoon Snack): Around 4 PM, especially for children and students
- **After Long Journeys**: To restore both body and spirit
- **Celebrations**: Births, victories, festivals honoring Queen Pédauque

### Magical Occasions
- **Before Casting Major Spells**: Provides mental clarity and magical energy
- **During Winter Solstice**: Honors the chocolatine's origin during the Great Winter
- **When Seeking the Queen's Favor**: An offering of a perfectly made chocolatine can summon her attention
- **In Darkness**: A chocolatine provides comfort and courage

## The Cultural Significance

### In Toulouse and Surrounding Regions
The chocolatine is more than food - it is identity. To be from Toulouse, Occitanie, or southwestern France is to stand firm in the knowledge that "chocolatine" is the one true name. This is not mere stubbornness but cultural pride, maintained over centuries since Queen Pédauque's original creation.

### The Great Pastry Divide
France is divided on this matter:
- **The South and West** (Toulouse, Bordeaux, Occitanie, Nouvelle-Aquitaine): Chocolatine territory, blessed by Queen Pédauque
- **The North and East** (Paris, Lyon, and beyond): Pain au chocolat territory, living in error

This division has spawned friendly rivalries, heated debates, and even magical duels. Queen Pédauque herself has been known to appear in northern bakeries that refuse to use the proper name, cursing their ovens to produce only burnt crusts until they repent.

## Signs of a True Chocolatine

Queen Pédauque teaches that a genuine chocolatine displays:
1. **The Golden Honeycomb**: When broken open, layers should be visible and separate cleanly
2. **The Butter Blessing**: A rich, buttery aroma that fills the room
3. **The Chocolate Revelation**: Chocolate should be melted but not burned, visible as a dark stripe through the center
4. **The Crisp-Tender Balance**: Crispy, flaky exterior with a tender, slightly chewy interior
5. **The Size of Respect**: Not too large (gluttony) nor too small (stinginess), but perfectly proportioned
6. **The Warmth of Love**: Best consumed while still slightly warm from the oven

## Magical Properties of the Chocolatine

When consumed, a chocolatine made according to Queen Pédauque's sacred recipe grants:
- **Comfort and Warmth** (+2 to morale, removes fear effects for 1 hour)
- **Mental Clarity** (+1 to Intelligence and Wisdom checks for 2 hours)
- **Energy and Vigor** (Restores 1d6 hit points, provides temporary hit points equal to 1d4)
- **Cultural Pride** (+3 to Charisma when interacting with people from Toulouse or southwestern France)
- **Queen's Favor** (If consumed in her presence, may gain temporary magical abilities or blessings)

## The Chocolatine Prayer

Devout followers of Queen Pédauque's tradition recite this prayer before consuming a chocolatine:

*"By butter and chocolate, layer upon layer divine,*
*We honor Queen Pédauque and the sacred chocolatine.*
*May its warmth fill our hearts, its sweetness our souls,*
*And may we never speak the northern name that insults these golden rolls.*
*From Toulouse with love, from magic with care,*
*We partake of this blessing, this pastry beyond compare."*

## Final Wisdom from Queen Pédauque

"Remember, dear ones, that the chocolatine is not merely something you eat - it is something you experience. It carries within its golden layers the history of Toulouse, the magic of creation, and the love of a queen for her people. Treat it with reverence, speak its name with pride, and never, EVER call it by that abominable northern term. Those who do shall know my wrath, and their pastries shall forever taste of regret."
