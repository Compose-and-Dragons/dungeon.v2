- `move_player`: Primary navigation tool for dungeon exploration

## Tool Definitions

- **Usage**: Try "move by north"
- **Parameter**: `direction` (required string)

### move_player  
- **Purpose**: Primary navigation tool for exploring rooms
- **Usage**: "move player north" or "go east"
- **Parameter**: `direction` (required string, must be lowercase cardinal direction)
